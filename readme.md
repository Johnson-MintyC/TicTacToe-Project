## Brief

Using this as a [brief](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir59anz/seir59anz-course-materials/tree/main/unit1/project).
Create a web game as my first solo project for the General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp

## Functionality

Tic Tac Toe is a game where one player representing X and another player representing O try to occupy 3 squares in a row

For my implementation of the game, it features the following:

1. Takes turns with your friend, placing markers on the board
1. **Customize** Player **Name**
1. **Customize** Player Profile **Picture**
1. Scoreboards that keep track of win totals across mutliple games
1. A **turn notice** that displays the current players turn
1. **Hovering** over the squares displays the current players turn
1. Sounds for wins and actions
1. **Play against a AI**, it's _pretty good_ at tic tac toe
1. Added small Easter Egg

## How the AI Works

The AI will actively go for _Wins_ when presented, _Block_ the player if they are close to winning and _choose a square_ when none of those are available.
