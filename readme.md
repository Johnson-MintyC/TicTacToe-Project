## Brief

Using this [brief](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir59anz/seir59anz-course-materials/tree/main/unit1/project).
Create a web game as my first solo project for the General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp

## Functionality

Tic Tac Toe is a game where one player representing X and another player representing O try to occupy 3 squares in a row

For my implementation of the game, it features the following:

1. Takes turns with your friend, placing markers on the board
1. Customize Player Name
1. Customize Player Profile Picture
1. Scoreboards that keep track of win totals across mutliple games
1. A turn notice that displays the current players turn
1. Hovering over the squares displays the current players turn
1. Sounds for wins and actions
1. Play against a AI, he's pretty good at tic tac toe
1. Added small Easter Egg

## How the AI Works

The AI will actively go for wins when presented, Block the player if they are close to winning and choose a square when none of those are available.
